## How to Contribute

#### **Did you find a bug?**

- **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability in Zap**, and instead to refer to our [Security Policy](../README.md#security).

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues][issues].

- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one][issues]. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, and as much relevant information as possible.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

- Before submitting, please read the [Coding Guidelines](#coding-guidelines) to know more about our coding conventions and practices.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

- Please join us on [slack][slack] and check [open issues][issues] to see what contributions are needed before tackling a task to avoid duplicate work.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

- Ask any question about the Zap source code in [slack][slack].

## Contribution Guidelines

### Pull Requests

The `master` branch will be used for all pull requests for the time being. This may change as the repo and contributors grow.

### Style Guide

This project has swiftlint rules and pull requests should pass before being merged. The swiftlint rules are not final by any means and can be changed if necessary.

### Tests

Tests should try to be written for every feature/fix and should pass before being merged. With the demand for the Lightning Network and Zap rising, rapid development will naturally leave some code untested but we should all try our best.
